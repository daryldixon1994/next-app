## Touch Events Removed

Now Swiper handles only Pointer Events, and doesn't rely on touch events like `touchstart`, `touchmove`, etc. So if your custom extra logic relies on these events, you should update it.

## Autoplay

Swiper v9 comes with fully reworked Autoplay module, that has new parameters, methods and events. Check <a href="/swiper-api#autoplay">Autoplay documentation</a> for more information.

## Loop Mode

Loop mode has been fully reworked in version 9 and now instead of duplicating slides, it rearranges current ones dynamically.

It comes with new limitation. Amount of slides in loop mode should be at least 2x of `slidesPerView` value.

`loopedSlides` with new logic works in a bit different way, and you probably should remove it or make sure it is less or equal to `slidesPerView`.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy images loading module has been removed and integrated to the core. Check <a href="/swiper-api#lazy-loading">Lazy Loading documentation</a> for more information.

## Dom7

Dom7 library has been removed from Swiper, and it uses vanilla JS for DOM manipulation. If your custom code relied on Dom7, you should change it.

## Swiper Angular

Swiper Angular components have been removed in v9. Use <a href="/element">Swiper Element</a> instead

## Swiper Solid

Swiper Solid components have been removed in v9. Use <a href="/element">Swiper Element</a> instead

## Swiper Svelte

Swiper Svelte components have been removed in v9. Use <a href="/element">Swiper Element</a> instead

export default function Page({ children }) {
  const components = {
    h1: Heading.h1,
    h2: Heading.h2,
    h3: Heading.h3,
    h4: Heading.h4,
  };
  return (
    <MDXProvider components={components}>
      <WithSidebarLayout meta={meta}>{children}</WithSidebarLayout>
    </MDXProvider>
  );
}
